# FAIR Principles Compliance Assessment

## FINDABLE

### ✓ F1: (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

**Evidence**:
- MLAsset base class includes both `id` (UUID, system-generated) and `persistent_identifier` (external PID like DOI/ARK)
- DataCite Metadata Schema integration documented for DOI support
- Data plan Phase 1 mentions DOI assignment for published assets

### ✓ F2: Data are described with rich metadata

**Evidence**:
- MLAsset provides comprehensive base metadata (identity, ownership, versioning, integrity, licensing, access rights)
- Entity-specific extensions: Model (architecture, framework, performance), Dataset (statistics, privacy, collection), Experiment (configuration, reproducibility, environment)
- Integration with international metadata standards documented

### ✓ F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

**Evidence**:
- All entities include explicit `id` (UUID) and `persistent_identifier` fields
- Integration mapping shows identifier fields mapped to dc:identifier, schema:identifier, datacite:identifier
- Metadata structure explicitly links identifiers to all asset descriptions

### ✓ F4: (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

**Evidence**:
- Internal indexing well documented: database indexes on created_at, access_rights, organization, framework, model_type, format, privacy_level (physical-model.md)
- Data plan Phase 5 documents REST API with query/filter capabilities by metadata fields and full-text search
- Data plan Phase 6 documents search by framework, model type, dataset format, organization, time period
- **External catalog integration** documented in data-plan.md Phase 5:
  - DataCite DOI registration with automatic metadata synchronization
  - re3data.org repository registry listing
  - Schema.org structured data for Google Dataset Search indexing
  - Disciplinary catalog integration (Papers with Code, Hugging Face)


## ACCESSIBLE

### ✓ A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol

**Evidence**:
- REST API documented in data plan Phase 5 (Share)
- Django REST Framework
- Standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols implied

### ✓ A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary

**Evidence**:
- MLAsset includes `access_rights` enum (PUBLIC, REGISTERED, RESTRICTED, EMBARGOED)
- Dataset includes `privacy_level` enum (PUBLIC, INTERNAL, CONFIDENTIAL, RESTRICTED, ANONYMIZED)
- Data plan Phase 5 documents access rights configuration based on privacy, ethics, and institutional policies
- REST Framework authentication configured

### ✓ A2: Metadata are accessible even when the data are no longer available

**Evidence**:
- **Comprehensive metadata persistence policy** documented in data-plan Phase 4
- **Metadata-only records**: Complete metadata persists indefinitely even when data files are removed
- **Asset lifecycle states** defined: ACTIVE, DEPRECATED, DELETED
- **Citation continuity**: DOIs continue to resolve to metadata

## INTEROPERABLE

### ✓ I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

**Evidence**:
- Integration with 11 formal vocabularies with defined namespaces
- All namespace URIs documented (dc:, dct:, schema:, dcat:, prov:, cr:, mls:, fair4ml:, mex:, hpc:, omh:)
- Data plan Phase 4 mentions metadata export in XML formats
- Integration mapping provides complete attribute-to-vocabulary mappings


### ✓ I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

**Evidence**:
- Standards from recognized international bodies (W3C, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, DataCite, MLCommons, RDA)
- Standards are actively maintained with persistent URIs and formal specifications
- Documented rationale for vocabulary selection emphasizing broad interoperability and domain specificity

### ✓ I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

**Evidence**:
- Comprehensive relationship documentation with cardinality specifications
- PROV-O integration for provenance chains (wasGeneratedBy, used, wasAttributedTo, wasDerivedFrom)
- Versioning via parent_version
- Experiment relationships: base_model (fine-tuning), datasets (via ExperimentDataset), produced_models
- ExperimentDataset captures qualified usage (role, split definition, preprocessing)

## REUSABLE

### ✓ R1: Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

**Evidence**:
- Detailed attribute specifications in logical-model with types, constraints, defaults, validation rules
- Multi-layered metadata: foundation layer (Dublin Core, Schema.org, DataCite, DCAT), ML layer (Croissant, ML-Schema, FAIR4ML, MEX), infrastructure layer (HPC Ontology)
- Enumeration types defined for controlled vocabularies
- Data plan Phase 1 documents metadata validation and normalization at creation time

### ✓ R1.1: (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

**Evidence**:
- MLAsset includes required `license` field
- Data plan Phase 5 documents license assignment strategy (MIT, Apache 2.0, Creative Commons, Open Data Commons)
- Mapped to dc:rights, schema:license, datacite:rights

### ✓ R1.2: (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

**Evidence**:
- W3C PROV-O integration throughout entities
- Versioning: parent_version field with recursive lineage retrieval method
- Experiment tracking: code_repository_url, code_commit_hash, environment_specification, random_seed, reproducibility_hash
- ExperimentDataset: split definitions with random seeds for reproducibility
- ResourceUtilization: complete computational resource tracking
- Attribution: created_by (Researcher with ORCID), organization, timestamps

### ✓ R1.3: (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

**Evidence**:
- ML-specific standards: Croissant (MLCommons), ML-Schema (W3C Community Group)
- Infrastructure standards: HPC Ontology (HPC-FAIR)
- Foundation standards: Dublin Core, Schema.org, DataCite, DCAT, PROV-O
- Data lifecycle framework: UK Data Service Data Lifecycle
- Complete attribute-to-standard mapping documentation
